Single-cell data Analysis with Knowledge inputs from User using Regularized Autoencoders (SAKURA) is a knowledge-guided dimensionality reduction framework. 
It focuses on the task of producing an embedding (i.e., a low-dimensional representation) of scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq data, to be guided by a large variety of knowledge inputs related to genes and genomic regions.
